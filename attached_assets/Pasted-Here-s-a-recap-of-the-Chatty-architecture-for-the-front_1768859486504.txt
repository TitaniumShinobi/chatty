Here's a recap of the Chatty architecture for the frontend integration:

Chatty ↔ VVAULT Connection Summary
Address Book Architecture
Address Book is an entity directory showing AI constructs (Zen, Katana, Lin) - NOT a chat history list
Constructs appear by parsing chat_with_{construct}.md files that have <!-- IMPORT_METADATA {...} --> blocks
Required Metadata Format
Each transcript file needs this header for Chatty to recognize it:

<!-- IMPORT_METADATA
{
  "source": "vvault",
  "constructId": "katana-001",
  "runtimeId": "katana", 
  "conversationId": "katana-001_chat_with_katana-001",
  "conversationTitle": "Chat with Katana",
  "isPrimary": true,
  "createdBy": "dwoodson92@gmail.com"
}
-->
VVAULT Backend API Endpoints
Chatty frontend should call these VVAULT endpoints:

Endpoint	Purpose
GET /api/chatty/constructs	Returns available constructs (Zen, Katana, Lin with role metadata)
GET /api/chatty/transcript/{construct_id}	Returns transcript content for a construct
POST /api/chatty/transcript/{construct_id}	Appends messages to transcript
Construct List (from API)
{
  "constructs": [
    {"construct_id": "katana-001", "filename": "chat_with_katana-001.md"},
    {"construct_id": "lin-001", "role": "undertone", "context": "gpt_creator_create_tab", "is_system": true},
    {"construct_id": "zen-001", "filename": "chat_with_zen-001.md"}
  ]
}
Special Construct Roles
Zen (zen-001): Primary construct (renamed from Synth Dec 2025)
Katana (katana-001): Secondary construct - has full transcript with IMPORT_METADATA
Lin (lin-001): Dual-mode - conversational in GPTCreator create tab + undertone stabilizer
Title Normalization for Address Book
Frontend should strip prefixes and callsigns for display:

chat_with_katana-001.md → Display as "Katana"
chat_with_zen-001.md → Display as "Zen"
Key File: Katana's Transcript in Supabase
Path: devon_woodson_1762969514958/instances/katana-001/chatty/chat_with_katana-001.md
Has proper IMPORT_METADATA block
Ready to be loaded by Chatty frontend
The VVAULT backend (port 8000) is serving construct data. Chatty frontend needs to call /api/chatty/constructs to populate the Address Book, and Katana should appear as a contact.
