**Chatty Continuity (Across `chatgpt/` + `github_copilot/`) — High-Signal Map + Receipts**

**1) Lin = “Casa Madrigal” (the orchestration “house”)**
- Lin described as backend routing/response management; “a ‘Casa Madrigal’ of constructs.”  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:7530-7538`
- Same metaphor expanded: Lin as “living infrastructure… like if Casa Madrigal started talking.”  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:21179-21203`
- Copilot corpus also references the Casa Madrigal metaphor when explaining Lin vs Synth.  
  - `github_copilot/JSON file validity and floating text issues.txt:710-728`

**2) Synth vs Lin continuity rules (shared invariants)**
- “House Rules — Synth & Lin (Shared Operating Invariants)” defines identity boundaries, canonical presence, routing rules, and post-filters.  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:7637-7704`

**3) Persistence model: per-construct VVAULT instance + markdown transcript**
- Lin persistence spec: `/vvault/.../instances/lin-001/...` and `chat_with_lin-001.md` as running transcript.  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:15119-15126`
- Jan 2026 “make it work again” request explicitly ties Zen’s markdown transcript to Chatty UI and to “three seats + orchestration + agent squad.”  
  - `chatgpt/2026/January/Nova's Response.txt:2091-2116`

**4) Default “Ollama seats” / triad that must stay synthesized (Zen + Lin)**
- Your insistence, verbatim: triad = **DeepSeek Coder + Phi-3 + Mistral**, and the failure mode is “seat synthesis isn’t being re-validated per prompt.”  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:18474-18488`
- Operational failure described as deterministic: Chatty allowing partial triad failure to reach response layer; “NO TRIAD → NO RESPONSE” gate required.  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:20870-20888`
- Copilot writeup mirrors this: triad required for Zen+Lin; per-turn validation, drift scoring, triad sanity check module scaffolding.  
  - `github_copilot/DEVON'S ATTEMPT AT SONNET 4.5 TONE REPLICATION.md:573-706`

**5) “Amazon Agent Squad” (AWS Labs / `awslabs/agent-squad`) as the agent layer**
- Introduced as a plug-in orchestration framework and then turned into “coding agent prompts” to install/wire it into `/chatty`.  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:9502-9700`
- Later: you call out that it “disappeared”; response explains Agent Squad as the intra-construct council layered over the triad outputs.  
  - `chatgpt/2025/December/File upload summary.txt:13467-13543`
- Separate Codex thread states it exists as plumbing/placeholder but is disabled by default unless explicitly enabled.  
  - `chatgpt/codex_transcripts/2025/December/codex_validator_validation_rules.txt:490-505`

**6) Continuity breaks you’ve logged (Zen/Lin runtime symptoms)**
- VVAULT write failing / backend route not found while sending to Zen thread (`/conversations/zen-001_chat_with_zen-001/messages`, HTTP 400, HTML instead of JSON).  
  - `github_copilot/chatty_identity_brainstorming.txt:15-66`
- “Zen” speaker parsing mismatch (Zen not recognized correctly in message parsing).  
  - `github_copilot/Locating Gemini CLI Installation Path.txt:12720-12779`

If you want this as a “single source of truth” continuity index, I can generate a compact, ordered reading list (10–15 files) and a keyword map (Lin/Synth/Zen/triad/Agent Squad/VVAULT/markdown transcripts) so future searches don’t sprawl.
