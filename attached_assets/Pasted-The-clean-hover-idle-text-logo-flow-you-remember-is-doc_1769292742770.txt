The clean hover + idle text-logo flow you remember is documented in cursor_implementing_inactivity_animatio.md (Export date 1/16/2026). That thread spells out the desired sequence—hover still runs at 80 ms swaps, and after 60 seconds of inactivity the “C” jiggle cycles 'C'hatty.png → 'C'hatty_1.png → 'C'hatty_2.png (with the 1 s hold and three rapid 80 ms swaps) before settling back to Chatty.png. It also explains the timer reset via global mouse/keyboard/click listeners and locking hover state so the idle animation fires only once. That’s the last time the text-logo animation was correct.

and then cycles through to the next letter right?

Yes—after the 'C' jiggle sequence completes, the plan in cursor_implementing_inactivity_animatio.md (lines 1-110) was to continue the routine across the remaining letters so each letter briefly animates before the entire “Chatty” word returns to its normal state. The same document spells out how the 60‑second idle timer fires once per letter (six letters → complete cycle every six minutes), so the next letter would start its own hold + rapid 80 ms swaps immediately after the previous letter finishes, keeping the logo gently breathing until you interact again.

please tell me what should be the flow of operation for the animation on hover of Chatty.png

Per cursor_implementing_inactivity_animatio.md, the hover flow is:

Hover the logo → isHoveringRef becomes true so idle timer is paused.
Hover animation runs at 80 ms frame swaps (same speed as before) toggling between Chatty.png and the jiggle frames ('C'hatty.png, 'C'hatty_1.png, 'C'hatty_2.png) to give that rapid wiggle.
When you mouse away, hover lock releases and the 60‑second inactivity timer resumes.
If you hover again before the idle cycle fires, only the hover animation plays; idle logic waits until the timer completes another 60 seconds before running the 'C' jiggle sequence or moving to the next letter.
So the hover animation is fast (80 ms steps), independent of the longer idle sequence, and it blocks the idle cycle while it’s active.

that is the inactivity. the hoverstate collapses the logo in on itself very cleverly

Right—what you’re describing is the hover-state collapse, not the idle jiggle. According to cursor_implement_slash_command_for_imag.md, hovering over the Chatty logo triggers a clever collapse-in animation: the logo shrinks or “collapses in on itself” while still showing the letters, then the hover animation runs (the rapid 80 ms swaps between the PNG frames) so it feels responsive. The hover handler also sets isHoveringRef, which keeps the 60‑second idle timer from starting its longer "C" jiggle sequence while your cursor is over the logo. When you move the mouse away, the hover state releases, the logo expands back to full size, and the idle countdown resumes. That’s the flow the code currently implements.
