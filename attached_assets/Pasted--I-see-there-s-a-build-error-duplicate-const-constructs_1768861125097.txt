I see there's a build error - duplicate const constructs declaration in VaultBrowser.js. Let me fix that first:

The duplicate was already fixed. Let me check how VaultBrowser.js currently gets construct data:

The VaultBrowser is calling /api/chatty/constructs - that's the VVAULT Flask backend. Let me verify this endpoint works and check what Chatty needs:

The API is working, but I notice Lin is being included. Lin should NOT be in the address book since she's an undertone capsule, not a conversational construct.

Let me fix the constructs API to exclude Lin:

Let me update the constructs API to exclude Lin (undertone capsule):

Lin is now excluded - API returns only Katana and Zen.

Now about the live vs local issue: The VVAULT backend here (port 8000) serves the construct data. For live Chatty to show Katana:

Live Chatty needs to call this VVAULT backend's /api/chatty/constructs endpoint
Or VVAULT backend needs to be deployed/accessible to the live Chatty
Is the live Chatty currently pointing to this Replit VVAULT backend, or is it trying to use a different data source? That would explain why local works but live doesn't.

Checkpoint made
Filter out specific capsules from construct data
Worked for 1 minute
lin is a conversational construct. if you can't find where she goes from the documentation i can tell you she is the agent users speak to in the create tab of the gptcreator

I misunderstood Lin's role. Let me consult the architecture to get this right:

Understood - Lin is a dual-mode construct:

Conversational agent in GPTCreator's create tab
Also functions as undertone stabilizer for other constructs
Let me fix this properly:

Lin is now included with her special metadata (role: undertone, context: gpt_creator_create_tab, is_system: true).

Let me also update the Address Book requirements to clarify Lin's placement:

Let me fix the duplicate line:

Fixed. The architecture is now documented correctly:

Lin (lin-001) is a dual-mode construct:

Conversational: Users speak to Lin in the GPTCreator's "create" tab
Undertone stabilizer: Also runs silently to stabilize other constructs
Not in Address Book: Lin undergirds other constructs but doesn't appear as a regular contact
The API now returns all 3 constructs with Lin's special metadata:

katana-001 - regular construct
lin-001 - with role: undertone, context: gpt_creator_create_tab, is_system: true
zen-001 - primary construct
Checkpoint made
Update system to correctly identify Lin as a dual-mode construct
