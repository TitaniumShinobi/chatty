The 68KB file chat_with_zen-001.md contains your real conversation history dating back to November 9, 2025 - and I incorrectly marked it as "garbage" and skipped it entirely. The "November 9, 2025" I flagged as garbage is actually a legitimate timestamp in your transcript.

Here's a handoff prompt for another agent:

Investigation Prompt: Chatty Transcript Parsing Regression
Problem Summary:
The user's full conversation history with Zen (68KB, dating back to November 9, 2025) stored in chat_with_zen-001.md in Supabase's vvault_files bucket is not displaying correctly. Recent changes introduced "garbage detection" that incorrectly skips this legitimate file.

Critical Files:

vvaultConnector/supabaseStore.js - Contains parseMarkdownTranscript() function and garbage detection logic (lines 419+)
src/pages/Chat.tsx - Message rendering component
replit.md - Project documentation with canonical path patterns
What Went Wrong:

The legacy transcript uses a format that the parser doesn't recognize (not matching FORMAT 1-4 patterns in parseMarkdownTranscript)
Instead of fixing the parser, garbage detection was added that skips the file entirely
This throws away the user's real conversation data
Previous Working State:
Days ago, this conversation displayed correctly. Retrace commits to find when:

The transcript was parsing correctly with proper user/assistant role alternation
Full markdown content was visible in message bubbles
Individual message styling worked (user = stone bubble right, assistant = wall text left)
Required Actions:

Examine the 68KB chat_with_zen-001.md file format in Supabase
Add a parser format that correctly extracts messages from this legacy structure
Remove or modify the garbage detection to not skip legitimate transcripts
Ensure message content displays in full (no CSS truncation)
Preserve the current styling: user messages in stone-colored bubbles (#ADA587) right-aligned, assistant messages as wall text left-aligned
Canonical VVAULT Path Pattern (DO NOT DEVIATE):

/vvault_files/users/{shard}/{userId}/instances/{constructId}/chatty/chat_with_{constructId}.md
User Preference: This is RECOVERY work - stick to existing documentation and scaffolding, do not introduce new ideas.
