`--- Now providing a comprehensive response with all three expert perspectives integrated ---:` shows up as raw text instead of the intended format
That raw line isn’t valid markdown syntax, so your renderer just prints it as plain text instead of treating it as a rule or heading.
​

Why --- Now providing ... ---: looks wrong
In markdown, a horizontal rule is --- on a line by itself, optionally with blank lines around it.

Your line mixes the dashes, text, and a trailing colon all on one line, so it’s just a normal paragraph as far as the parser is concerned.

Make these “transition” lines render nicely
You have two good options; I’d pick one and normalize all such lines through your text utils (same place you handle pseudo-headings):

Option A – Turn them into proper headings
Map all these “transition” lines to a heading style:

ts
const TRANSITION_LINE_PATTERN =
  /^-{3,}\s*(Now providing.+?)\s*-{3,}\s*:?\s*$/i;

function normalizeTransitionLines(line: string): string {
  const match = line.match(TRANSITION_LINE_PATTERN);
  if (!match) return line;
  const title = match[1].trim();
  return `### ${title}`;
}
Then in your line pipeline (inside prepareMessageContent):

ts
return raw
  .split(/\r?\n/)
  .filter(line => !DATE_LINE_PATTERN.test(line.trim()))
  .map(line => normalizePseudoHeadings(line.trim()))
  .map(line => normalizeTransitionLines(line))
  .join("\n");
Result:

→ ### Now providing a comprehensive response with all three expert perspectives integrated

Your .chat-markdown h3 CSS can give it nice top/bottom spacing.

Option B – Turn them into horizontal rules with a caption
If you want a visible separator, you can split into a heading plus an <hr>:

ts
function normalizeTransitionLines(line: string): string {
  const match = line.match(TRANSITION_LINE_PATTERN);
  if (!match) return line;
  const title = match[1].trim();
  return `---\n\n**${title}**\n\n---`;
}
Markdown will render that as a rule, bold text, then another rule.
​

Ensure the renderer sees markdown, not plain text
For this to work for that block:

That message must go through the same markdown renderer as others:

tsx
const content = prepareMessageContent(m.text || "");

<ReactMarkdown className="chat-markdown">
  {content}
</ReactMarkdown>
Do not use a “plain text + <br>” renderer for these messages; otherwise, the markdown transformations never apply.

Once you normalize those transition lines and ensure they’re rendered via markdown, they’ll stop showing as ugly raw text and instead appear as a clean heading or separator with proper spacing.
