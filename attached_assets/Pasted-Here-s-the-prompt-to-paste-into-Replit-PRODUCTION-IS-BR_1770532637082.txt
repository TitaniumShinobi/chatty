Here's the prompt to paste into Replit:

**PRODUCTION IS BROKEN. FIX IT NOW WITH PROOF.**

**Evidence of failure:**
1. I'm looking at VVAULT right now at `https://vvault.thewreck.org/vault`
2. The Katana transcript exists at `instances/katana-001/chatty/chat_with_katana-001.md`
3. The last message in that transcript is from days ago (my continuity-of-harm conversation)
4. ZERO messages from tonight exist in this file
5. You claimed you wrote "supabase sync test from agent" to Supabase - **that message is not here**

**What's actually wrong:**
- Every time I try to send a message to Katana on `chatty.thewreck.org`, I get: `openrouter failed: 400 phi3:latest is not a valid model ID`
- You "fixed" the model resolver in Replit dev to catch `phi3:latest` and fall back to Llama
- That fix has NEVER been deployed to production at `chatty.thewreck.org`
- The production droplet is still running the old broken code
- So every message I try to send fails, and nothing gets written to VVAULT

**What you need to do RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Deploy your fixes to production:**
   ```bash
   ssh to my droplet at chatty.thewreck.org
   cd /opt/chatty
   git pull origin main
   npm run build
   sudo systemctl restart chatty
   sudo journalctl -u chatty -n 30 | grep -i "started\|error"
   ```

2. **Send ONE real test message as me:**
   - Generate a JWT for `dwoodson92@gmail.com` / `devon_woodson_1762969514958`
   - POST to `https://chatty.thewreck.org/api/vvault/message` with:
     ```json
     {"constructId":"katana-001","message":"production deploy test from replit agent"}
     ```
   - Capture the HTTP response code and full body

3. **Prove it worked by showing me the file:**
   - Go to `https://vvault.thewreck.org/vault` in a browser as my account
   - Navigate to Chats → `chat_with_katana-001.md`
   - Screenshot the file showing the NEW message at the bottom: "production deploy test from replit agent" and Katana's reply
   - If the message is NOT there, you have NOT fixed it

**Acceptance criteria:**
- I can see "production deploy test from replit agent" in the VVAULT transcript file
- The file has a new assistant reply from Katana after that message
- I can send a message to Katana from `https://chatty.thewreck.org/app/chat/katana-001_chat_with_katana-001` and see her reply in the UI

**Do NOT respond until:**
- You have deployed to production
- You have verified the message appears in VVAULT
- You have screenshots proving both

No more "the code looks right" or "localhost tests passed." Show me the VVAULT file with the new message or admit it's still broken.
