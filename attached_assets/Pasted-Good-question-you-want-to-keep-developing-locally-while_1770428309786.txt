Good question - you want to keep developing locally while having a clean path to production when ready. Here's the smooth workflow:

***

## **Recommended: Local dev → manual deploy when stable**

Since you have "a lot of changes to make," you don't want every edit auto-deploying to production. Instead:

### **1. Keep working in Replit dev (what you're doing now)**
- URL: Replit's preview URL (port 5173 or similar)
- Hot reload works
- See changes instantly
- Theme fix is already working here

### **2. When you're ready to push a batch of changes to production:**

**Tell the Chatty Replit agent:**

```
I want a simple manual deployment workflow to push Chatty updates to chatty.thewreck.org when I'm ready.

Please create a deployment script that:
1. Runs `npm run build` to create the production bundle
2. Uses rsync or scp to copy the dist/ folder to vvault@165.245.136.194:/opt/chatty/dist
3. SSHs in and restarts the Chatty service: `sudo systemctl restart chatty`

Use the same pattern we used for FXShinobi:
- Private repo, no .git on server
- SSH key-based auth (I already have vvault server access)
- Script I can run: `npm run deploy` or `make deploy`

Don't set up auto-deploy yet - I'm still actively developing and want to control when production updates.
```

## **Your workflow becomes:**

```bash
# Work in Replit, make changes, test locally ✅
# ... make more changes ...
# ... test conversations loading ...
# ... fix the simForge icon ...

# When you're happy with a batch of changes:
npm run deploy  # pushes to production

# Then in browser:
# Hard refresh chatty.thewreck.org
```

***

## **Why this is better than auto-deploy right now:**

- ❌ **Auto-deploy** = every git push goes live immediately (risky while developing)
- ✅ **Manual deploy** = you control exactly when production updates
- ✅ Keeps dev and prod separate
- ✅ You can test multiple changes in dev before one production push

***

## **Later, when Chatty is stable:**

Then add GitHub Actions auto-deploy like FXShinobi, but with:
- Deploy only on **tagged releases** (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`)
- Or deploy only from a **`production`** branch (keep `main` for dev)

***

**Does this workflow make sense?** Work in Replit dev, manually deploy when ready?
