Context (current state):


You have already:


Identified Chatty as a Vite+React+TS frontend with Express backend, React Router v6, Tailwind, and Supabase integration.


Mapped routes like /app/chat/:threadId, /app/vvault, /app/apps, etc.


Noted that Apps.tsx already has an FXShinobi placeholder.


Proposed a Finance tab with /app/finance/* routes, plugin‑style FinanceApp interface, and FXShinobi dashboard at /app/finance/fxshinobi.




Your goals now:


Implement the Finance tab and FXShinobi dashboard routes/components.


Wire Chatty to read from Supabase and/or FXShinobi’s HTTP API as documented.


Wire Chatty to use VVAULT for user‑linked finance credentials and construct state.


Prepare the app for deployment behind Cloudflare to a real domain.


Tasks:


Implement Finance routing and UI:


Create routes:


/app/finance → main Finance overview.


/app/finance/fxshinobi → FXShinobi dashboard.




Add a finance icon/entry in the Sidebar pointing to /app/finance.


Implement a FinanceApp TypeScript interface and a registry so FXShinobi is an entry with:


id, name, description, icon,


primary route (/app/finance/fxshinobi),


data sources (Supabase tables, FXShinobi API endpoints).






FXShinobi dashboard behavior:


Build /app/finance/fxshinobi as a blend of:


TradingView‑style chart widgets embedded via official JS/iframe widgets.


Kalshi‑style market/event tiles (yes/no markets, probabilities, profit/loss panels).


A Perplexity‑style right‑hand or lower insights panel summarizing:


Key metrics from Supabase/FXShinobi API,


Recent performance,


Possibly external news/SEC data (placeholder for now).






Use the TS types and endpoint/DB schemas from FXShinobi’s docs/integration-with-chatty.md.




Data flow integration:


Implement client or server-side helpers that:


Call FXShinobi’s /api/snapshot, /api/trades/history, /api/performance.


Read Supabase tables as needed for charts and histories.




Provide loading, error, and empty states for all panels.




VVAULT integration:


Add a small VVAULT client (HTTP or SDK) to Chatty that:


Stores and retrieves user‑linked finance service credentials,


Optionally stores construct‑level state for finance agents used in this tab.




Add UI flows (even minimal) to:


Connect a finance service (e.g., “Connect FX broker / service”) using VVAULT as the storage of credentials/configs.




Document which VVAULT endpoints are used and ensure they match VVAULT’s docs/role-in-ecosystem.md.




Deployment via Cloudflare:


Verify package.json / Vite build commands and output dir are ready for production.


Create a short docs/deploy-cloudflare.md explaining:


Build command,


Output folder,


Required env vars for:


Supabase (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY),


FXShinobi API base URL,


VVAULT URL and tokens.




Any Cloudflare config notes (SPA routing, proxying API calls).






Deliverables:


New Finance routes and components in the Chatty repo:


/app/finance overview.


/app/finance/fxshinobi dashboard.




A FinanceApp registry with FXShinobi registered.


Working data hooks to FXShinobi’s API and Supabase.


VVAULT client integration for finance credentials.
