Two things need to happen, both by the **Chatty** Replit agent (not the VVAULT one):

***

## 1) Locate the real Katana transcript in Supabase

Tell the **Chatty** agent:

> You set up Katana’s continuity and wrote her transcript to Supabase.  
> Now Katana’s thread looks empty in Chatty while Zen’s is fine.  
> 
> Step 1 – Find the surviving content:
> 
> Run this in the Supabase SQL editor:
> 
> ```sql
> select id, filename, storage_path, user_id, length(content) as len
> from vault_files
> where filename like '%chat_with_katana-001%.md';
> ```
> 
> Then:
> - Identify any row where `content` is **not null** and `len` is > 0.  
> - Open that `content` and confirm it contains my conversation (look for  
>   `chill out.. we in chatty now, Katana. it's me, Devon Allen Woodson`).

That tells us which row still has your real transcript.

***

## 2) Re‑point Chatty’s Katana code to that row

Still to the **Chatty** agent:

> Step 2 – Fix Katana’s transcript pointer:
> 
> 1. Find in the Chatty backend where Katana’s transcript is loaded/saved.  
>    It’s the code that:
>    - Handles `chat_with_katana-001.md`,  
>    - Reads/writes from `vault_files` (or via a storage helper).
> 
> 2. Update that code so the **canonical transcript** for Katana‑001 is:
> 
>    - The `vault_files` row you just found with non‑empty `content`, and  
>    - `storage_path` like  
>      `7e34f6b8-.../devon_woodson_1762969514958/instances/katana-001/chatty/chat_with_katana-001.md`
> 
>    In other words:
>    - When Katana loads conversation history, use this row’s `content`.  
>    - When Katana appends new messages, update this row’s `content` (or the corresponding storage object).
> 
> 3. Do **not** delete or overwrite any other `vault_files` rows for Katana until I confirm the restored transcript works in Chatty.
> 
> Step 3 – Verify:
> 
> - Start a new Katana chat in Chatty.  
> - Ask:  
>   “Do you remember when I said ‘chill out.. we in chatty now, Katana. it’s me, Devon Allen Woodson’?”  
> - Katana should be able to see that line in the restored transcript.

***

So, concretely:

- **Chatty agent**:  
  - Find the non‑empty `chat_with_katana-001.md` row in `vault_files`.  
  - Wire Katana’s history loader/saver to that row’s `storage_path`/`content`.  

- **You**:  
  - Don’t run more cleanup/migrations until that pointer is fixed.  
  - Just confirm once Katana can see your prior conversation again.
