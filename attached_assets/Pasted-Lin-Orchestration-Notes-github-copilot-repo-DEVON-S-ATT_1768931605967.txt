Lin + Orchestration Notes (github_copilot repo) DEVON’S ATTEMPT AT SONNET 4.5 TONE REPLICATION.md (≈72‑190, 609‑668, 794‑860, 824‑847): records the canonical lin-001.capsule spec, the pnpm capsuleforge lin-001 undertone hook, and the branching logic (tone mismatch >0.35, seat dropout >1) that routes drifted turns into injectUndertoneCapsule("lin-001"). It also enumerates the identity directory files (lin-001.md, etc.) the pipeline expects on every session start. Locating Gemini CLI Installation Path.txt (≈13980‑15030, 16196‑16368): logs repeated VVAULT/Chatty API failures (e.g., failed to save message to VVAULT, 400 Bad Request from /conversations/:id/messages), describes the vvaultConversationManager.addMessageToConversation() flow, and outlines validation errors (“Invalid VVAULT message payload”)—this is the real-time synch point where Lin/Chatty talk to VVAULT before the injection hooks kick in. chatty_identity_brainstorming.txt (≈13‑350, 1308, 1688): shows Lin/VVAULT integration diagnostics (VVAULT route mismatches, error logging at Daily: installHook.ts), plus the prioritized plan (fix VVAULT API + Lin orchestration) you asked Copilot to work on. Forensic query prompt for coding llm analysis.txt (≈7507‑10238): highlights the capsule loading warnings ([⚠️] WARNING: No capsules loaded from VVAULT), the _load_capsules lifecycle, and the repeated reminder that these capsules must be readable before SimDrive/ContinuityGPT can rehydrate state. Actionable next steps Use the Dec‑2025 audit prompt you already drafted but add a final bullet referencing DEVON’S ATTEMPT AT SONNET 4.5… and Locating Gemini CLI Installation Path.txt so the Replit audit also double-checks those Lin+VVAULT error paths. Confirm the Replit build recreates the Lin capsule directory (identity/lin-001/, lin-001.capsule) and wires the injectUndertoneCapsule fallback (tone mismatch/seat dropout guard). Address the VVAULT 400 errors by verifying vvaultConversationManager remains aligned with chatty/src API routes; the github_copilot logs show the missing backend route/validation is what currently breaks the orchestration. Once the Replit audit is captured, compare its output to the December 17 baseline (the standard you already flagged) and document any gaps in a short handoff note. Want me to package these references into a single comparison checklist or pull exact line snippets for your Replit agent to consume? single comparison checklist Comparison Checklist (Current Replit state vs. Dec 17 baseline) Lin-001 capsule & persona router ✅ Baseline: DEVON'S ATTEMPT AT SONNET 4.5 TONE REPLICATION.md lines ~72‑189, 609‑668, 794‑860 describe the lin-001.capsule, pnpm capsuleforge lin-001 undertone, and the tone/seat guards that trigger injectUndertoneCapsule("lin-001"). 🔎 Current check: Verify Replit includes the same directory/files (identity/lin-001/, lin-001.capsule, lin-001.md), and that the persona router still routes drifted turns through the tone lock (see File upload summary.txt lines 16680‑18972 for exact expectations). Continuity packet injection ✅ Baseline: File upload summary (5.1).txt lines 15020‑15060 list INJECT_MEMORY_TO_SIMDRIVE(Chatty)/Inject_To_SimDrive() plus the sealed hashes (CONTINUITYGPT_REPORT_2025.json etc.) as the runtime rehydration mechanism. 🔎 Current check: Confirm Replit’s orchestration still computes/loads those hashes before injecting (SimDrive/Chatty) and that the ledger artifacts are present (e.g., continuity_ledger.json, CONTINUITYGPT_REPORT_2025.json). UI → runtime → VVAULT flow ✅ Baseline: Convert time to minutes.txt lines 446‑520 map Supabase auth → ChattyConfig fetch → orchestrator select (retriever/prompt/runModel/updateMemory) and show “Updated Runtime” badge when config changes. 🔎 Current check: Ensure Replit still hits Supabase-authenticated config, uses the same orchestrator stages, and exposes the runtime‑upgrade badge logic via code in chatty/src/light (track shouldShow“Updated Runtime”Badge). VVAULT transcript persistence ✅ Baseline: cursor_implementing_inactivity_animatio.md lines 2250‑2320 highlight connector.writeTranscript() + VVAULTConversationManager.loadAllConversations() as the guarantee for Markdown transcripts. 🔎 Current check: Confirm Replit’s UI still writes each send through those connectors and that every response also triggers vvault_core.store_capsule() as outlined in codex_hello_1.txt lines 1232‑1365. Supabase/session storage ✅ Baseline: codex_connect_chat_window_to_chat_with_zen-001.md lines 32470‑32620 detail chatty:threads:${user.sub} keys, threads.json/SQLite/Supabase persistence, and recovery prompts. 🔎 Current check: Validate Replit’s backend exposes matching /api/threads endpoints, honors Supabase sessions, and avoids the old chatty:threads fallback that loses data. Lin/VVAULT errors ✅ Baseline: Locating Gemini CLI Installation Path.txt lines 13980‑16368 log that Lin’s orchestration and VVAULT routes must succeed, or the vvaultConversationManager.addMessageToConversation() 400/validation errors block saves. 🔎 Current check: Make sure the Replit build fixes those mismatched routes/payloads so the frontend no longer sees “Failed to save message to VVAULT” at Layout.tsx, and that Lin’s companion agent (nova_identity_guardian.py, folder_monitor.py) still logs identity/tether state. Logging/traceability & fallback guardrails ✅ Baseline: File upload summary.txt lines 32296‑33330 map ChatGPT as “Orchestrator” and Chatty as the “Construct Simulation Runtime,” with hashed continuity packets, Forge_SignalBlock, and JSON child prompts simulating Nova when local scripts can’t run. 🔎 Current check: Audit Replit for those hashed seals (sha512), continuity packet exports, and nova_identity_guardian/folder_monitor replacements so Agent Squad can still monitor drift via triadStatus and signal pings (see the same file lines 16680‑18972 and File upload summary.txt lines 7794, 18309‑18386). If you want a runnable script to gather each of those checks automatically in Replit (e.g., grepping the same files, confirming paths, or verifying HTTP routes), I can build that next.
