You are working in the Chatty repository on Replit.
I want you to reorganize the FXShinobi trading dashboard UI to match this layout, using the existing components already in the Chatty codebase.
Target Layout
Header (left → right)


Back button (far left of the page)


A vertical stack of:


Refresh (top)


Settings (bottom)




Title + subtitle for FXShinobi


Status badge (live / loading / error)


Insight / AI seat label on the far right (this was “financeLLM”; treat it as the Insight AI seat)


Main content (center/left column, top → bottom)


Broker connection / broker status panel


Chart showing what FXShinobi is actively trading


Performance metrics (P&L, win rate, total trades, etc.)


Orders / Activity (trade history with filters and pagination)


Prediction Markets (Kalshi integration)


Script logs section (15s refresh; it’s okay if data is not wired yet, but the UI block must live here and clearly indicate it shows trading script output)


Right side column


AI Insights panel (FXShinobi‑specific AI analysis)


Intelligence widgets:


ForexFactory calendar


Finviz heatmap


Currency Strength


Compound Calculator


Weekend Training (or similar external intel widgets already present)




Requirements


Identify the main FXShinobi screen component in this repo (for example FXShinobiPage.tsx or similar) and:


Implement a header + 2‑column layout (main + right sidebar) using the existing layout system and styling conventions in Chatty (no new CSS framework).


Reuse existing FXShinobi components for:


broker,


chart,


performance,


orders/activity,


prediction markets,


script logs,


AI insights,


external intelligence widgets.
Do not change their internal logic; just reorganize how they are placed and grouped.






Keep all current behavior intact:


30s market snapshot auto‑refresh,


15s script logs refresh,


existing filters and pagination for trade history,


Kalshi integration as-is.
This is a layout refactor only.




Make the layout responsive:


On wide screens: header on top; main content in a left column; right‑side AI/Intelligence column on the right.


On narrow screens: follow the existing responsive patterns in Chatty. It’s fine if the right column stacks below main content or becomes a collapsible section—reuse any existing responsive utilities / layout wrappers.




Update any header labels so the AI seat on the right is branded as “Insight” rather than “FinanceLLM”, matching the current direction of the product.


Deliverables


Update the main FXShinobi page component with the new layout.


If you create or touch any shared layout wrappers (e.g., a TwoColumnLayout, PageHeader, or similar), keep them generic and consistent with Chatty’s existing style.


Briefly explain in comments or a short summary:


Which file is the main FXShinobi page.


Which components you used for each of:


Broker


Chart


Performance


Orders/Activity


Prediction Markets


Script logs


AI Insights


Intelligence widgets.






Do not change any backend or trading logic; only reorganize the UI structure to match this spec.
