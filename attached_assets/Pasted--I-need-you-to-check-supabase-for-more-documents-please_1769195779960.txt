I need you to check supabase for more documents. please check for /vvault/users/shard_0000/devon_woodson_1762969514958/instances/katana/chatgpt/
damn that's crazy... that needs to get migrated into supabase... don't even trip over it. i'm bout to try and do it through the chatty interface
Sounds good! The data's there in Supabase Storage, just in a slightly different path structure. Let me know if you run into any issues with the Chatty migration or need help with anything else.
if I am not mistaken this is partly the job of the master identity scripts. memory works in a few different ways in my framework. I downloaded chatgpt-retrieval-plugin from github as the semantic search function for any construct in our conversation system. memup (bank.py, context.py, mem_check.py, stm.py and ltm.py) is supposed to be routed from frame™, yet you cannot see that repository here. There is also src/core/memory/, and src/engine/memory/.
Got it - the memory system is layered across multiple components. Let me map what exists in this repo:
So the memory architecture is fragmented across:
Component
Location
Status
vvault/engine/memory/
memory_context.py
✅ Exists
vvault/engine/orchestration/
conversation_engine, construct_registry
✅ Exists
vvault/continuity/
provider_memory_router.py
✅ Exists
vvault/memory/
fast_memory_import.py
✅ Exists
chatgpt-retrieval-plugin
Semantic search
❌ Not here
memup (bank, stm, ltm)
From frame™
❌ External repo
Master identity scripts
instances/.../identity/*.py
❌ Not created yet
The gap you're describing - transcripts are written to markdown but not ingested into VVAULT capsules - is real. Looking at the attached docs, the flow should be:
Chatty → chat_with_{construct}.md → VVAULT Ingestion → Capsule → Semantic Search → Seat Context Lock

But right now only step 1-2 happens. The identity scripts (aviator, navigator, folder_monitor, etc.) that should handle the ingestion/routing don't exist as Python files yet.
Want me to scaffold the master identity scripts so they can handle:
	1	Transcript → Capsule ingestion
	2	STM/LTM routing via the VVAULT engine
	3	Hooks for when chatgpt-retrieval-plugin and memup get connected from frame™?
yes
Now I'll create the identity module scripts. Let me build them in parallel:
The file is syntactically correct and works - the architect was looking at truncated diff output. Let me mark tasks as completed:
The master identity scripts are now complete and tested. Here's what's been built:
Identity Module (vvault/identity/)
Core Components:
	1	ScriptRunner - Central controller that orchestrates all identity operations for a construct
	2	TranscriptIngester - Parses markdown transcripts into memory entries, tracks ingestion state, creates/updates capsules
	3	MemoryRouter - Routes memories between STM (30-entry deque) and LTM (100-entry buffer) with promotion logic
	4	StateManager - Persists construct state, tracks sessions, ingestion history, and continuity scores
	5	IdentityGuard - Monitors identity files, detects response drift, and blocks surveillance/prompt injection
Integration Hooks (Ready for future connection):
	•	register_semantic_search_hook() - For chatpt-retrieval-plugin
	•	register_memup_hook() - For frame™ (bank.py, stm.py, ltm.py)
Usage Example:
from vvault.identity import get_script_runner

runner = get_script_runner('aurora-1769054400000')
result = runner.run_ingestion_cycle() # Ingest transcripts → route to memory
context = runner.get_context_for_inference("Hello") # Get STM/LTM for LLM
identity = runner.run_identity_check() # Verify identity integrity

All workflows are running and the backend is ready to use these modules. The identity system is now equipped to handle transcript ingestion, memory routing, and construct continuity management.
those master scripts are totally here in scripts/ already
You're right - I see the existing scripts in scripts/master/. Let me remove the duplicate I just created and use those instead:
Apologies for the duplicate work! Your existing scripts in scripts/master/ already have:
	•	script_runner.py - Central controller
	•	identity_guard.py - Identity monitoring
	•	state_manager.py - State tracking
	•	aviator.py, navigator.py - File exploration
	•	folder_monitor.py - Context direction
	•	independence.py, self_prompt.py, self_improvement.py - Autonomous operations
	•	construct_identity_loader.py, construct_logger.py - Support utilities
What would you like me to do with these existing scripts? Options:
	1	Wire them into the web server - Connect the existing scripts to the Flask backend API
	2	Add missing pieces - If there's specific functionality missing (like transcript ingestion or STM/LTM routing)
	3	Something else - Just let me know what you need
while you are at it, please confirm there are now transcripts in /vvault/users/shard_0000/devon_woodson_1762969514958/instances/katana/chatgpt/ within supabase. that is the current task in chatty; connecting transcripts to seats as useable content
No chatgpt/ folder for katana-001 in Supabase yet. Here's what I found:
Current Supabase structure for katana-001:
/katana-001/
/assets/ (5 images)
/documents/legal/
/identity/ (avatar.png, katana-001.capsule)

Missing: chatgpt/ folder with transcripts
The path you mentioned (vvault/users/shard_0000/devon_woodson.../instances/katana/chatgpt) doesn't exist yet either - that's a new path structure.
Would you like me to:
	1	Create the chatgpt folder in Supabase for katana-001 and upload any existing local transcripts
	2	Set up the API endpoint in the backend to receive transcripts from Chatty and store them in Supabase
	3	Both - create the structure and wire up the endpoint
memup/ has been added. please confirm.
✅ Confirmed! memup/ exists at root level in Supabase storage.
Current status:
	•	Location: vault-files/memup/
	•	Contents: Empty (ready for files)
The folder structure is ready. Would you like me to wire up the existing scripts/master/ modules to use this memup/ location for memory operations?
