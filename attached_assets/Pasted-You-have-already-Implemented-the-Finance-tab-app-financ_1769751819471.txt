You have already:


Implemented the Finance tab:


/app/finance overview hub.


/app/finance/fxshinobi full dashboard.




Built a financeAppRegistry, FXShinobi dashboard UI, TradingView chart widget embed, Kalshi‑style tiles, AI insights panel, trade history table, and VVAULT client integration.


Added Cloudflare deployment doc and a finance architecture doc; current frontend uses mock data fallbacks while backend/Supabase is wired.


Your goal now is to switch the Finance tab from mock data to real FXShinobi + Supabase + VVAULT, and make Chatty ready to deploy behind Cloudflare.
Tasks:


Replace mock data with live data:


Add configuration for:


FXSHINOBI_API_BASE_URL


SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY


VVAULT_URL, VVAULT_SERVICE_TOKEN




In the FXShinobi dashboard hooks/components:


Call real FXShinobi endpoints (/api/snapshot, /api/trades/history, /api/performance, /api/status) instead of mock services.


Use Supabase client to pull any additional historical data you documented.




Keep graceful fallbacks, but make the default path “live” when env vars are present.




VVAULT integration for user connections:


Wire the “Connect Service” / broker linking UX so that:


On save, it calls VVAULT’s /api/vault/credentials to store user‑linked finance credentials.


On load, it calls /api/vault/credentials/{key_name} to populate existing connections.




Ensure key names and payloads match what VVAULT’s docs/role-in-ecosystem.md specifies.




Verification UI:


On /app/finance and /app/finance/fxshinobi, surface:


FXShinobi engine status (from /api/status),


VVAULT status (from your VVAULT health endpoint),


Supabase connectivity (simple check or inferred from data loads).




Provide clear “not configured” messages when any piece is missing, instead of silent failure.




Cloudflare deployment readiness:


Confirm build command and output folder for production (Vite).


Make sure the app works as an SPA when served behind Cloudflare (history fallback / client‑side routing).


Update docs/deploy-cloudflare.md with:


Final list of required env vars (Chatty, FXShinobi, Supabase, VVAULT).


Example Cloudflare config (or notes) for proxying API requests to FXShinobi and VVAULT.






Deliverables:


Finance tab and FXShinobi dashboard fully reading from live FXShinobi API + Supabase, using VVAULT for credentials.


“Connection status” indicators visible in the Finance UI.


Updated Cloudflare deploy doc that I can follow to point a domain at Chatty and have everything working end‑to‑end.
