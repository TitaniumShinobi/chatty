Personal data is retained only as long as necessary for service provision, legal compliance, or as explicitly consented.
All user-generated content and account metadata are stored through VVAULT, where each record maintains a Nested Record Continuity Ledger (NRCL) trail documenting creation, modification, and deletion events.

We will honor valid requests in accordance with applicable law and our internal governance frameworks.
