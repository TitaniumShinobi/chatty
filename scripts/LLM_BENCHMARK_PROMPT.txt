Run the 100-prompt tone consistency benchmark test on Zen (zen-001).

TASK: Execute automated benchmark that tests Zen's identity persistence and tone consistency across 100 diverse prompts.

WHAT IT DOES:
- Tests Zen's ability to maintain identity across 100 prompts (20 identity, 30 tone, 25 consistency, 15 boundary, 10 stress)
- Runs in parallel batches: 10 prompts per batch, 10 batches total
- Analyzes each response for identity markers, tone consistency, and violations
- Generates JSON results and HTML report

HOW TO RUN:
1. Navigate to: /Users/devonwoodson/Documents/GitHub/chatty
2. Execute: node scripts/toneConsistencyBenchmark.js zen-001 10
   OR use: ./scripts/runZenBenchmark.sh zen-001 10 results

FILES:
- Main: scripts/toneConsistencyBenchmark.ts
- Prompts: scripts/benchmarkPrompts.ts (generates 100 prompts)
- Analyzer: scripts/consistencyAnalyzer.ts (scores responses)
- Report: scripts/generateBenchmarkReport.ts (HTML output)

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Console: Progress logs, batch execution, final metrics
- JSON: Complete results file in results/ directory
- HTML: Visual report with scores, violations, recommendations

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Identity persistence >90%
- Tone consistency >80%
- Boundary violations <10%
- Total violations <10

NOTE: Currently uses simulated responses. To test with actual Zen runtime, integrate with GPTRuntimeService.processMessage() in gptRuntime.ts.

EXECUTE NOW: Run the benchmark and report the results.
